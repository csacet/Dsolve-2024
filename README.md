## Idea
CET complaint registration app
A platform where one can submit complaints and suggestions regarding their class, their department or the entire college as a whole. 
Students can view the respective complaint/suggestion submitted by others wherein they can upvote or downvote the suggestion. This would eventually help to convert this app into a platform where we would be able to view the suggestions and complaints of public interest sorted based on the number of votes.
